### By default, ESLint will only output the first error it finds in each file. To see all errors, you can add the --quiet flag:
eslint --quiet .

### You can also fix some of the errors automatically by running the eslint command with the --fix flag. This will modify your code to adhere to the rules whenever possible:
eslint --fix .
